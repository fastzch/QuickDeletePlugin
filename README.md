Quick Delete Line/Lines Plugin for Xcode

What's this?
---
I like delete line(s) feature by shortcut key (crontol/+d, command+d on Mac) so much on Eclipse, but Xcode does not has this feature.Fortunately, Xcode provides plugin mechnism, so I developed this plugin.

This plugin is so simple, and easy to use to delete line(s), the delete logic is same to Eclipse.
